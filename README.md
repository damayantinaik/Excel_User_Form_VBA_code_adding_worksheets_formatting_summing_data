# Creating an User Form with Macros and VBA code adding worksheets formatting and summing data

This project is about creating an User Form which I created with VBA code, combining multiple Macro procedures.  The User Form contains  a Label, two buttons and a combo box. The form was meant to automate selecting a worksheet from the workbook, adding new worksheet(s) and running the report.
I prepared the code in the following steps: 
1.	Added an User Form 
2.	Added one Label, one Combo box, two Command buttons
3.	Wrote VBA code to select a worksheet, add new worksheet, name it and if error arises handle it.
4.	Prepared Macros creating VBA procedures adding headers & formatting the numerical values to currency with dollar sign. The code was tailored to skip the empty worksheet.

The data file and the workbook with User Form along with VBA code can be found at the following link:
